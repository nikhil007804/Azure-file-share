# Azure-File-Share

## Overview

This project provisions an **Azure File Share** using Terraform.  
Azure File Share is a fully managed file share in the cloud that you can mount simultaneously via the SMB protocol from Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is ideal for scenarios where you need shared storage accessible by multiple VMs or services.

### Key Features of Azure File Share

- Fully managed, highly available file storage in Azure.
- Supports SMB and NFS protocols.
- Can be mounted on-premises or in the cloud.
- Integrates with Azure Active Directory for access control.
- Scalable and secure.

## Project Structure

- `provider.tf` – Configures the Azure provider and subscription.
- `main.tf` – Declares the resource group, storage account, and file share.
- `variables.tf` – Defines input variables for customization.
- `terraform.tfvars` – Sets actual values for the variables.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` – GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD.

## Step-by-Step Usage

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed.
- An Azure subscription.
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed and authenticated (`az login`).
- (For CI/CD) A Service Principal and `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret set in your GitHub repository.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Pratyushaa94/Azure-File-Share.git
cd Azure-File-Share
```

### 3. Configure Variables

Edit `terraform.tfvars` to set your desired values:

```hcl
resource_group_name   = "my-resource-group"
location              = "East US"
storage_account_name  = "prathyusha9sj2"
file_share_name       = "prathyushafileshare"
file_share_quota      = 10
```
> **Note:** Storage account names must be globally unique and use only lowercase letters and numbers.

### 4. Initialize Terraform

```powershell
terraform init
```

### 5.Review the Execution Plan

```powershell
terraform plan
```

### 6. Apply the Configuration

```powershell
terraform apply
```
Type `yes` when prompted to confirm.

### 7. (Optional) Destroy Resources

```powershell
terraform destroy
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project includes a workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically deploys your infrastructure on push or pull request to the `main` branch.

**To use:**
- Create an Azure Service Principal and add its credentials as the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret in your GitHub repository.
- Push your changes to GitHub. The workflow will run Terraform commands automatically.

## Theory: How Does Azure File Share Work?

Azure File Share provides a cloud-based SMB file share that can be mounted by multiple clients.  
- **Resource Group:** Logical container for Azure resources.
- **Storage Account:** Securely stores your file shares, blobs, queues, and tables.
- **File Share:** The actual SMB/NFS share you can mount and use for file storage.

**Use Cases:**
- Shared storage for applications running on multiple VMs.
- Lift-and-shift of on-premises file shares to the cloud.
- Centralized file storage for distributed teams.

## Important Notes

- Storage account names must be unique across Azure.
- File share quota is specified in GB.
- Ensure your Azure credentials are set up for both local and CI/CD deployments.
